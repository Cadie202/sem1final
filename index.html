          <p1 style="font-size: 21px; margin-left: 40px">Hello! I personally would like to welcome you to the new, and improved, Anti Squirrel website. The old one's picture weren't showing up so we changed it a bit. This website is meant to inform people about the growing threat of.....squirrels. Although they are cute fuzy animals inside they are plotting the distruction of the entire planet. You may be thing "woah really!?!?! Wait...how do you know this", well i'll tell ya. Late one night I had a vision of the universe being ruled by squirrels. They were torturing all other sepcies including humans!!! I vowed from that day to stop the invasion from happening in order to save the world and all its inhabitants. If you don't believe me or think the squirrels aren't evil then THEY WILL BRUTALLY KILL YOU!!!!!!!! Have fun on the website :) </p1>
