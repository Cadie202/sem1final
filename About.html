        <h1 align="center">What We're About</h1>
        <p1 style="font-size: 21px; margin-left: 40px">The Anti Squirrel Campaign is all about setting the facts right. Every 20 seconds a child is misinformed about the dangers of squirrels. Squirrels have evil intentions that are hard to come by. Here's an example. Have you ever been walking underneath a tree and suddenly an acorn hits your head? Ever wonder who threw it? I have an answer for you.....it was a devilish squirrel! Those acorns contain a gas that changes your perceptive on life. Like this gentleman right here...</p1>

    <p1 style="font-size: 21px; margin-left: 40px">This young man's name is Ethan. Almost everyday while walking home from school he would be struck by a vile acorn. He would look up and see a few squirrels laughing at him with disgust. He would then run hme crying. It was life scaring for him and now this boy lives in a psychiatric ward paranoid that the squirrels are fllowing him. I know this because I had an interview with him. He kept saying the squirrels were after him and if he didn't escape he would die. Little did he know how correct he was.Later that day I heard news from one of the caretakers that Ethan had passed away and in his room was an acorn. There was no way Ethan would go near an acorn with his sevre paranoia. By now you should know who did this dispicable act...it was a squirrel trying to keep conspiracy theorists from causes world wide panic by revealing their plans.</p1>

    <h3 style="margin-left: 15px">What Do You Plan On Doing With The Squirrels?</h3>
    <p1 style="font-size: 21px; margin-left: 40px">Our plan for eradicating this world of all squirrels has 3 stages. Stage 1 is capture the squirrels and put them in a remote location where no one can help them escape. Stage 2 is get information out of them. It is known throughout the Anti Squirrel community that squirrels understand and can speaking english. If there are more squirrels in the universe they must be found and killed to prevent any future disaster. Stage 3 is slaughter the squirrels and give their bodies to butchers. This way the human race will benefit by gaining more food resources. The stages can be done within a few months as long as no inncidents occur.</p1>

There are appromimately one million living squirrels today. Their population numbers are increasing every year in order to over power us and rule the planet.</p1></p1>
